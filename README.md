# Using csv Files to Construct a Simple Database Using C
### Basic Plan
1. Process a given csv file with the first row as column names and the next rows as the columns
2. You will need to get rid of white space to save it correctly
3. You will need to produce errors if the data is ill formatted (more rows in the data than columns in the table)
4. You will need to be able to add rows and delete rows
5. You will need to be able to retrieve one row based off one column
6. You will need to be able to retrieve rows based off one column
7. You will need to be able to retrieve rows based off columns
8. Process two linked csv files, if one of the columns of one csv file is called 'Name_Id' and the other database is called Name with an Id, then you know that the two are linked, and should be able to perform join calculations
9. Get csv files over a network and be able to do all of the above
